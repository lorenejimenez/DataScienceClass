### 1: State of the art
Many mammals produce food calls to inform conspecifics that they found a new source of food. Chimpanzees represent a species that use this mechanism often. The exact function of this behavior is not yet known. Different hypotheses have been raised: for example, it has been suggested that food calls allow individuals to strengthen their social bonds. However, this hypothesis is not enough to explain the existence of this behavior which imply a considerable cost for the caller. An important question to ask is: how is this behavior induced in individuals if it does not imply a direct benefit for them? One possibility is that this behavior is induced by group control from other individuals because it benefits the group as a whole. More precisely, I will try to show that chimpanzees use negative direct reciprocity as a mechanism to "punish" individuals that did not produce a food call when they could have. 

### 2: Research question
Is direct negative reciprocity used to induce cooperative behavior in food-sharing contexts in chimpanzees?
### 3: Hypotheses
1. If an individual does not produce a food call when he had the occasion, and if others discover it, they produce an aggressive answer (negative direct reciprocity). 
2. The individual that undergoes this aggressive answer will increase his food calling in the near future. 

## Methods
### *Step 1*
Data collection will occur in Budongo Conservation Field Station. It will last 6 months, from August 2022 to February 2023. 

### *Step 2*
I will write my thesis during the second semester of my second year, spring 2023.
